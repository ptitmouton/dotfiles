# Alexis' dotfiles

## Usage

These dotfiles are meant to be used with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

## Installation

On a new machine, you will need to have Chezmoi installed:

``` bash
# on macOS, install homebrew, then chezmoi
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install chezmoi
# on arch
pacman -S chezmoi

# Then init
chezmoi init git@github.com/ptitmouton/dotfiles
chezmoi apply
```

### Manual Steps

**TODO**: Could probably be automated via AppleScript or so

#### iTerm

For iterm, you will have to set the config dir:

- Open iTerm
- Open Preferences Settings (iTerm2 > Settings > General > Preferences)
- Tick "Load Preferences from a custom folder or URL"
- Enter "$HOME/.config/iterm" into the text  field
